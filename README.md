# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project 
## Goals of the assignment

This assignment asks to clean some data generated by a wearable computer and to create some tidy data that can be used for additional analysis. The solution to this assignment is contained in the R script **run_analysis.R**.\
The data can be dowloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. This contains data from 30 volunteers performing 6 kinds of activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). The data comes from the accelarator installed in a Galaxy S smartphone. The 30 people were randomly assigned to two gorups: 70% were assigned to a training group and the remaining 30% to a test group.\
The first goal of the assignment is to merge consistently the data for the two groups so to generate a tiny dataset. In particular, the R script will perfom the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Furthermore, it will also create a second, independent tidy data set from the dataset in point 4, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
